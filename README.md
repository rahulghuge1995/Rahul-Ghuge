Principal Component Analysis on a dataset containing chemical analysis of wines

This article applies the PCA technique to a dataset containing chemical analysis of wines grown in a particular region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars (or classes). PCA has been implemented using two different libraries to check whether the output reproduces the same result. The dataset contained 13 dimensions which were reduced to two principal dimensions that represented the entire dataset with minimum losses.
